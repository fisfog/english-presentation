Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Today, I want to share something about Rock'n Roll with you. Through my presentation, you will learn the history and have a simple understanding of rock'n roll. 

OK, let's enter the world of Rock'n Roll. First of all, let's learn about the history of Rock'n Roll. In 1950s, the word Rock'n Roll was born. This new music is mixed with the two different music, Blues \& Country. Only the Black enjoy the Blues and only the White love the country music. Some people who was tired to make some change to the music to enjoy more people, and the Rock'n Roll was there. 

The 1960s to 1980s is a very important period to rock, the meaning of Rock'n Roll has changed, it's not a music but a attuide to life, people should be himself or herself, breaking the traditions, expressing your own mind, longing for peace, changing this world... etc.. It is the Rock'n Roll, you can play Rock'n Roll if you want to, no matter who you are and where you are, are you black or white, are you rich or poor, the only thing we need is to be ourselves, to produce a peaceful world through Rock'n Roll! 

However, sometimes, people believed rock'n roll is noise, the violence is derived from it, and drags, decadence, cynical even more, they are not rock'n roll, not the real meaning of rock'n roll. Remenber, rock'n roll is not the surface but the inner of life.

I love rock'n roll. When I'm upset, rock'n roll always cheers me up. It teaches me how to face my life, how to understand this world and how to love. So I wish you can try to listen it and if you have any quesion please feel free to ask me or email me.

In the last, I would like to quote the words of Neil Young to the end of my presentation. It's also the last words of Cobain. " It's better to burn out, than fade away. " 

That's all. Thank you very much!
